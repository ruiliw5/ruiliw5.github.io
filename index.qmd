## About 
Hello! Hello! I’m a fourth-year Data Science major (Informatics minor) at the University of California, Irvine🎓. My work focuses on learning analytics, AI-supported writing, and equitable EdTech: I analyze multi-quarter course datasets and translate findings into clear, actionable insights for instructors and researchers, with an emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, and equity. 

At UCI’s Digital Learning Lab, I've been involved in both Converse to Learn project and Generative AI project🤖. I’m also a [**CP-LEADS Fellow**](https://sites.uci.edu/cpleads/) and a [**PALiISaDS Scholar**](https://www.paliisads.org/), experiences that deepen my training in education-focused data science, and I serve as an HR Board Member for the Chinese Union at UCI, where I support event data analysis, operations, and student engagement🤝. My interests include Learning Analytics, Educational Data Science, NLP for Writing Support, and Data Visualization🔬.
