## About

Hello!👋 I’m a fourth-year Data Science major (Informatics minor) at the University of California, Irvine🎓. My work focuses on learning analytics, AI-supported writing, and equitable EdTech: I analyze multi-quarter course datasets and translate findings into clear, actionable insights for instructors and researchers, with an emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, and equity.

At UCI’s Digital Learning Lab, I've been involved in both Converse to Learn project and Generative AI project🤖. I’m also a [**CP-LEADS Fellow**](https://sites.uci.edu/cpleads/) and a [**PALiISaDS Scholar**](https://www.paliisads.org/), experiences that strengthen my training in statistics, machine learning, and research communication. Outside academia, I serve as an HR Board Member for the Chinese Union at UCI, supporting event analytics, operations, and student engagement🤝. 

My interests include Machine Learning, Educational Data Science, NLP for Writing Support, Statistical Modeling, and Data Visualization📊 — especially building transparent, scalable, and human-centered data systems that turn real-world data into meaningful impact🔬.
