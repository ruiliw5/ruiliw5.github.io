## Project 1

**A Little Secret**

I built an interactive AI chatbot platform designed specifically for children in three age groups: **Ages 5–7**, **8–12**, and **13+**. The platform is powered by **OpenAI’s ChatGPT API** and enhanced with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver age-appropriate, context-aware responses.

To ensure safety and personalization, the chatbot asks for the child's **age and region** at the start of the conversation. This allows it to tailor its responses based on developmental stage and local relevance—providing a more thoughtful and responsible AI experience for kids.

## Project 2

**Capstone Project – Delayed Antibiotics Administration**

**Collaboration:** Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC)

**Duration:** January 2025 – June 2025

Collaborated with CHOC to develop a data-driven predictive model identifying and classifying the severity of delayed antibiotic administration in pediatric patients. The goal was to assist clinicians in proactive intervention, improving patient outcomes and hospital efficiency.

**My Contribution:**

-   **Data Engineering:** Engineered an ETL pipeline to consolidate and clean pediatric antibiotic data, foundational for robust feature engineering and predictive modeling.

-   **Model Development:** Led the development and optimization of a Random Forest model to classify delay severity. Performed hyperparameter tuning, feature analysis, and benchmarked against other statistical models.

-   **Evaluation & Communication:** Conducted rigorous model evaluation using ROC curves and confusion matrices, effectively communicating performance and insights.

-   **Collaboration & Management:** Collaborated closely with clinical stakeholders for requirements and validation; managed project codebase and documentation on GitHub for team collaboration.

## Project 4

**Analyzing Related Factors to Computer Science Conferences Publications**

This project investigates key factors associated with publication output in computer science conferences.

Began by processing and preparing the data, including thorough data cleaning, wrangling, and mining. Then gathered and organized open-source data in JSON format from NSF and NIH, enabling a deeper analysis of how various factors impact the number of conference publications.

## Project 5

**Dolendar System Requirements**

This project involved developing a comprehensive report tailored to the client's specific needs and requirements. After a focused two-hour consultation, I carefully synthesized the client's input and compiled all key insights into a well-structured document.
