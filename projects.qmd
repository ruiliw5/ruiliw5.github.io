## Project 1

**A Little Secret**

I built an interactive AI chatbot platform designed specifically for children in three age groups: **Ages 5–7**, **8–12**, and **13+**. The platform is powered by **OpenAI’s ChatGPT API** and enhanced with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to deliver age-appropriate, context-aware responses.

To ensure safety and personalization, the chatbot asks for the child's **age and region** at the start of the conversation. This allows it to tailor its responses based on developmental stage and local relevance—providing a more thoughtful and responsible AI experience for kids.

## Project 4

**Analyzing Related Factors to Computer Science Conferences Publications**

This project investigates key factors associated with publication output in computer science conferences.

Began by processing and preparing the data, including thorough data cleaning, wrangling, and mining. Then gathered and organized open-source data in JSON format from NSF and NIH, enabling a deeper analysis of how various factors impact the number of conference publications.

## Project 5

**Dolendar System Requirements**

This project involved developing a comprehensive report tailored to the client's specific needs and requirements. After a focused two-hour consultation, I carefully synthesized the client's input and compiled all key insights into a well-structured document.
