### Research Experience

Research Assistant, [UCI Digital Learning Lab](https://www.digitallearninglab.org/)

Summer 2024 – Present

Working under Dr. Mark Warschauer, I’ve contributed to multiple education-focused research projects at the intersection of learning science and AI.

-   Papyrus AI Project (January, 2025 – Present):

    -   Currently supporting research on an AI-powered writing support system designed to improve students’ writing skills and learning outcomes. My work involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and evaluating usage patterns across diverse student populations.

-   Converse to Learn Project (June, 2024 – 2025):

    -   Participated in data collection and annotation for a project exploring how conversational agents can enhance student engagement and learning in educational settings.

This experience has deepened my understanding of educational technology, human-AI interaction, and quantitative research methods, while also giving me opportunities to collaborate across interdisciplinary teams.
